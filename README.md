# Cluster-Collision

Hello! This project is a project currently under construction by Noah Wolfe.
If you'd like to contact me, just email me at noahwolfe1999@gmail.com

The main goal of this project is to create a simulation using the AMUSE framework in python, which simulates the collision of two open star clusters. This is to determine if complex structures emerge due to gravitational interactions on local
interstellar scales.

THIS IS ANOTHER EDIT
HEY, LOOK HERE'S ANOTHER!
