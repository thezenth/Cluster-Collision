# Cluster-Collision

Hello! This project is currently under construction by Noah Wolfe.
If you'd like to contact me, just email me at noahwolfe1999@gmail.com

The main goal of this project is to create a simulation using the AMUSE framework in python, which simulates the collision of two open star clusters. This is to determine the types of complex structures which may emerge due to gravitational interactions on local interstellar scales. It is also to determine if the presence of stars greater than the 150 stellar mass limit (Crowther et al., 2010) could be due to collisions of stars during a cluster merger.
